# Sorting-Visualiser
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
A visualisation tool for commonly used sorting algorithms. 
These include Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Bubble Sort and Selection Sort.
Check it put <a href="https://sorting-visualiser.onrender.com/">here</a>

You can generate new random Arrays on the top left and change the array size and sorting speed via the select.
While a sort is in progress, it will become orange and you are unable to select another until the current one finished.
By chaning size or shuffeling the array it it is possible to reset it though.

After finishing the Sort will turn green and an animation will play indicating that it successfully completed.

This project was build using React with Vite as the building tool and no additional packages are used.
