# Sorting-Visualiser
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
A visualisation tool for commonly used sorting algorithms. 
These include Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Bubble Sort and Selection Sort.

You can generate new random Arrays on the top left and change the array size and sorting speed via the select.
While a sort is in progress, it will become orange and you are unable to select another until the current one finished.
By chaning size or shuffeling the array it it is possible to reset it though.

After finishing the Sort will turn green and an animation will play indicating that it successfully completed.

This project was build using React with Vite as the building tool and no additional packages are used.
I decided to learn React as it is the most commonly used libary for building static webpages. Moreover I only build functional components to learn more about Hooks.

The whole site is only styled by CSS. This deecision was definitly wrong in retrospect but safed time in the beginning. If I would start over again, I would probably use SCSS since style variables would have been very beneficial and would make changing colors trivial.

The most important learning progress I hade is while writing the sorting algorithms themselfs. Especially Heap Sort and Merge Sort with a linerar space complexity were a challenge.
